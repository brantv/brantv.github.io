      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think this poker project has to be that complex. Right off the bat, I would have a user enter how many players there will be. I would create a list of every card possible. I think it would have to subsist of four lists to separate the suits, with each list containing the card numbers. Then, a for loop would run x times, with x being the number of players.</description>
