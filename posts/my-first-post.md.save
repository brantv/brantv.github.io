I don't think this poker project has to be that complex.  Right off the bat,
I would have a user enter how many players there will be.  I would create
a list of every card possible.  I think it would have to subsist of four
lists to separate the suits, with each list containing the card numbers.
Then, a for loop would run x times, with x being the number of players.   The
loop would give each player 5 cards by randomly choosing from the list.  It 
would also need to check if a card is a repeat and replace it if it's already
in a hand.  It could add these to new lists for each player, then print 
each player's "hand" list.  If I decide to take the easy route, I could just
ignore the suits and simply have 4 copies of each card number.  I would assign
each card a value, with ace being the highest and 2 being the lowest.  I could
find the player with a card of the highest value and print out the winner.  If
I decide on the harder route, it would probably take a lot of if statements
to decide if a player has a certain hand.  Each different hand would also have
a different value, with royal flush (or whatever is the best hand) being the 
highest, and a pair being the lowest.  It would also have to compare the
highest card in that hand if another player happens to have the same hand.
